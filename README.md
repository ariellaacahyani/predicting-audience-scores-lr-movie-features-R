# 🎬 Predicting Audience Scores: A Linear Regression Analysis of Movie Features

This project uses linear regression in R to analyze how movie features—such as IMDb rating, MPAA rating, runtime, genre, and critic score—relate to audience scores. The goal is to understand which features significantly influence audience perception of movies.

## 📚 Project Type
Individual – Final Class Project

## 🎯 Objective
To model and explain audience scores based on key movie characteristics and evaluate their predictive power.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- R
- tidyverse (ggplot2, dplyr)
- broom, infer
- R Markdown

## 📈 Key Findings
- IMDb and critic scores were the strongest predictors of audience scores.
- Runtime showed moderate influence.
- MPAA rating and genre had limited effect.
- Adjusted R²: ~0.62
